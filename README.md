This is a simple **To-Do List** application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to add, edit, delete, and view tasks with details such as name, priority, deadline, and description. The application stores data in a **MongoDB** database.

## Features
- Add tasks with priority, description, and deadline.
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- View tasks with their details.

## Technologies Used
- **MongoDB** - For the database.
- **Express** - Backend framework for handling HTTP requests.
- **React** - Frontend for building the user interface.
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for the backend.
- **Axios** - For making HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend.
